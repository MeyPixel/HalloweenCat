# HalloweenCat
It's a Halloween Cat drawing made in CSS.
This is made following a tutorial by a webdev Twitter user named Pokecoder. All credits to her.
I changed the colours using the HEX colour system.

I uploaded this for getting used to use Github for uploading my projects.
Please don't use Mozilla Firefox for opening the page, it doesn't work properly in that browser.
